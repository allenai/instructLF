The environment I used probably contains too much libraries than what's actually required.

Instead, as a starting point, make sure you code is compatible with these libraries:
- Pytorch (+cuda)
- Huggingface Transformers
- Sentence Transformers
- OpenAi
- Other dependencies of Dongfu Jiang's LLM-engies library
- Standard ML packages: numpy, pandas, scipy, et. al.
