User: Hello! I'm more of an action movie or a good romance and mystery movie.
System: I just saw the trailer for Knives Out when I went to see Joker and it looked like a good mix of action and mystery!
User: I seen that one too as I seen Joker about a month ago. I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it.
System: It looks like a good movie for people who like many different movies. It also has a great cast! I was surprised to see Chris Evans in the trailer!
User: Maybe with Chris Evans in it it'll be easier to convince my fiance to see it. Do you know who else is in the cast?
System: Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis are also in the cast. Daniel Craig does a lot of 007 so definitely a good hearthrob role to convince the misses lol!
User: I am the misses lol. But he loves the bond movies so that should be a good incentive for him to go see it. Do you have any other recommendations?

System: You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best.

System: Hi, I am here to help you look for movie trailer!
User: hello!
System: I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like?
User: I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films!
System: Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do.
User: That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite?
System: Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah.
User: That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary?
System: A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians.
User: That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation!
System: Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing.
User: That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries?
System: No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste.
User: That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like.
System: Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time.
User: I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is Hoop Dreams, have you seen that?
System: Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash.
User: I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though.
System: How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s?
User: I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately. I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it. Any recommendations?

System: Hi I am here to help you look for a movie trailer! what type of trailers do you like to watch?
User: I like comedies. Something that's well written and clever.
System: I like comedies also. Who is your favorite comedian?
User: I like comedians too, but I don't think of comedy movies and comedians in the same category exactly. Again, I like clever comedy much more so than just comedy that relies on shock value.
System: when you say clever comedies are you referencing to ones like to the tonight show?
User: I mean clever as in well written dialog vs. something that relies on slapstick. So more When Harry Met Sally and less Dumb and Dumber.
System: Yes I like those also! Have you seen the dialog commercial with skittles and she kisses him and he becomes infected with skittles also. I that one was really clever.
User: Yes, I do think I remember that commercial.
System: I saw Dumb and Dumber but was there a part 2? I don't think that I have seen it!
User: Yeah, I never had any desire to watch part 2. I like Jeff Daniels a lot, but that's just not my type of comedy.
System: I you have not seen Coming to America with Eddie Murphy I would like to suggest that movie for you to watch! It has a nice comedy content.
User: I saw it a long time ago. Definitely leans more toward the goofy vs clever dialog though. So not really a good fit for me.
System: I often think about a classic movie Weird Science. What do you think of that one?
User: Still in the style of goofy vs clever. I'm not a fan of those types of movies. Maybe something with Sandra Bullock?
System: Yes I like Sandra Bullock especially the Movie Rush and there is a recent one she just stared in.

User: Oh, good. Thank makes sense. I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time.
System: That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times! There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison.

System: Hey, how are you doing? I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.
User: Great! Do you know of any romantic comedies?
System: Yes, the Long Shot with Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron came out earlier this year and was great!
User: I never heard of that one but I like Charlize Theron, she is usually in good movies. Can you tell me a little about it?
System: The two leads are opposites, but are brought together by their careers. They bond when they realize that Charlize Theron's cahracter was Seth Rogan's character's baby sitter. Seth Rogan is in his typical stoner role, but it doesn't come off contrived. Charlize Theron plays a sophisticated diplomat.
User: Oh that sounds good, I think I will watch it. Thanks for the good recommendation!

User: Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about? I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic.
System: It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments.

User: Are there more movies like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Meyerowitz Stories you recommend?

I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me.
System: Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world.

System: Hello, how are you? I went to the movie theater last night and saw Knives Out, it was awesome! Have you seen it yet, or been to the movies lately? I absolutely see why Knives Out was rated at around 97% rotten tomatoes.
User: Hello, I am well thanks for asking. How are you? I can't say I have seen that movie or even heard of it. I am interested in a romance is there anything that you would recommend?
System: Have you seen To all the boys i still love you on netflix? Part 1 came out last year, and part 2 was recently released! It plays off the narrative of the first one and has some very interesting romances/flings/secret relationships... Plus it has some heart warming comedy. Do you like any other movie types?
User: No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment.
System: the first one is actually called To all the boys I've loved before and the second is called To all the boys p.s. I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?
User: OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well.
System: You should watch the movie so you can find out. It stars a handful of Netflix's new age of top actors and actresses like Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, and Janel Parrish.

System: I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it.
User: I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it?
System: Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it.
User: Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about?

System: 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion.
User: Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda.
System: It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run.
User: Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction?
System: It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!

When young farmhand Jack (Nicholas Hoult) unwittingly opens a portal between his realm and a race of giants, it rekindles an ancient war. Roaming Earth for the first time in centuries, the fearsome giants seek to reclaim the land they lost long ago. Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself.

User: Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old?
System: Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good.
User: Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot
System: I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!

System: yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt

System: That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre?

I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well.

System: What was the last romantic comedy you watched?
User: The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorites. The music is always great in his movies.
System: Cool! Haven't seen that one in forever. So are you looking for something similar?
User: Yes! I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy. You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them!

System: Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz?
User: I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals.
System: If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like.
User: I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please.
System: Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true.
User: So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level.
System: She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc...
User: Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation!

I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.
System: Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.
User: I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!

Sometimes it's fun to see how an ordinary person can become extraordinary, and how they cope with having super powers and the responsibility to protect people but still try to live a regular life.

System: Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?
User: We both like action movies :)
System: Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?
User: The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little...
System: Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?
User: Yes, a similar one please :)
System: I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.
User: We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?

System: I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.

I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.
User: Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.

System: I do too! Very entertaining. what was the last adventure film you watched?
User: I just had to re-watch Polar all over again last week
System: I didn't see that one yet but Jonas Akerlund directed that and I love his work. He also makes great music videos.
User: Yeah, he is a great director. I loved his Lords of chaos as well
System: SO movie that reminds me somewhat of Polar (what I've heard of it) that I thought was excellant is Atomic Blonde, starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography. The trailer is definitely worth a watch.
User: Oh, that sounds intriguing. I'd love to see that one pretty soon. I love the sound of cold war as the story-line. I think I'd love it
System: Oh awesome!
User: Nice one then....I think my next movie is Atomic Blonde
System: Yeah it is a great film to watch especially as I imagine you won't have much to do in the coming weeks! I also loved the color that was used in the film, the use of neon lights. Great.
User: Yeah, I'm free next week and I'm going to see the movie definitely. Thanks for this awesome recommendation.

User: That sounds interesting, what was it about?
System: It's about a Leprechaun who has his gold stolen and is on a murderous mission to get it back! It also stars Jennifer Aniston and has many comedic moments.
User: Oh wow, I've never heard of it but that sounds like something I'd be interested in. I'll have to check it out.
System: It's really fun! I heard that Warwick Davis is tied to a sequel for the movie Willow for Disney + but it's been many years since I saw the original. No word on Val Kilmer coming back yet. He's great in everything.
User: Oh, I didn't know that. Thank you for the recommendation, I'll be watching that soon.
System: Cool! It's nice to dig up old obscure movies, especially since I've seen too much Netlflix
User: That's true. I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest?
System: Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player. It did very poorly at the box office but it's now a cult classic.
User: That's a good one, I saw that a while back. I thought it was pretty good but I could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. I still haven't seen the second one.

User: i like fast and furious all of them i can't wait to watch the final hobbs&shaw

System: Haha...fair enough.
User: lol
System: Are you a Dwayne Johnson fan?
User: oh yea i watched all his movies and i even knew him way before he starts to film movies i knew him he was in WWF
System: Same here! It's pretty cool watching his transition from wrestler to full on movie actor
User: its amazing but the being in the field of acting really matches him lot better
System: oh yeah for sure. I think the new Jumanji movie will be pretty awesome. I was pretty impressed with the last one
User: yap so true. his body amaze me for his age
System: No kidding! I thought you're supposed to get smaller with age, that guy just bulks up more and more
User: oh yeah
System: I just rewatched one of his older movies the other day and he looks like a baby compared to now
User: amazing changes but fits him perfect even better
System: oh most definitely. seems like dwayne johnson and kevin hart are a pretty good working combo though
User: kevin hart is something different but when i see them act together they really match in comedy compering to others u see them mix with rolls

System: Prodigy is actually a Hulu tv show. It's a bit like Criminal Minds but the star is the son of a famous serial killer. There's another movie that looks kinteresting called Se7en. It's loaded with stars like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Serial killings based on the 7 deadly sins
User: Yes Se7en sounds like my type of movie. Gonna watch this one today. I am a fan of crime investigations and serial killer documentaries as well.
System: Great. Me too.
User: I recommend a great movie called The Cleansing Hour. It has a twist to it.
System: That's brand new. Looks interesting.
User: Its one of those movies that has a good spiritual message but still has the modern day internet users as part of the story. It has lots of blood and gore. Beware.
